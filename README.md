# CryptoClustering

## Module 19 Challenge

  The included code was developed exclusively using the starter code provided and knowledge obtained during class. No TAs, instructors, or other students were consulted for help in developing the code.

  This repository uses basic unsupervised machine learning methods to analyze clustering in cryptocurrency data. First, a Kmeans model is applied with cluster number determined by elbow curve analysis, then a Principal Component Analysis is carried out. All data is scaled using StandardScaler for both tests, so as to reduce disproportionate influence on the models by variance in order of magnitude between variables. Last, results bewteen the two tests are compared.
